# chinesecopulasclefts
In line with the typological distribution of cleft constructions, Chinese consists of the copula verb (e.g. Mandarin 是 shi) selecting a clause headed by the adnominaliser (e.g. Mandarin 的 de) in which there is focus movement. This project looks at the historical and comparative distribution of Chinese dialectal copular and cleft constructions.
